# The Caves of Clojure

The code for my [Caves of Clojure][caves] series of blog posts.

[caves]: http://stevelosh.com/blog/

## Usage

Clone the repo.

Run `lein deps` to pull down deps.

Follow along with the entries by using tags:

    hg update entry-06
    git checkout entry-06o

That will put you at the code as it stood right at the *end* of entry number
six, so you can see how it all works together.

You can run the program by running `lein trampoline run` twice.  No, I don't
know why you need to do it twice -- you just do.

You can also just load it up in your Swank/Eclipse/whatever setup.
